    "Conversational models are currently a trending subject in the field of AI research. Chatbots are commonly used in various scenarios such as customer service platforms and online help desks. These bots typically utilize retrieval-based models that provide pre-set responses to specific types of questions. While these models might be adequate for highly specific domains like a company's IT helpdesk, they lack the robustness required for broader applications. However, the recent surge in deep learning, spearheaded recently by ChatGPT, has led to the development of potent multi-domain generative conversational models. In this guide, we will create one such model using the tools we have learnt so far.\n",

The `evaluate` function handles the input sentence, it formats the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size==1*.

A `lengths` tensor is also created which contains the length of our input sentence. The decoded response sentence tensor is obtained using our `GreedySearchDecoder` object (`searcher`). Finally, the response’s indexes are converted to words and the list of decoded words is returned.\n",

This process is looped for continuous interaction with our bot until we enter either “q” or “quit”.\n",

    "### Seq2Seq Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chatbot uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which takes a variable-length sequence as input and returns a variable-length sequence as output. This is achieved by using two separate recurrent neural nets (RNNs): an **encoder** and a **decoder**. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a fixed-length context vector, which theoretically contains semantic information about the input sentence. The decoder takes an input word and the context vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a hidden state for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one token at a time, outputting an \"output\" vector and a \"hidden state\" vector at each time step. The hidden state vector is passed to the next time step, while the output vector is recorded. The encoder uses a multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and a bidirectional variant of the GRU. An `embedding` layer is used to encode our word indices in an arbitrarily sized feature space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a token-by-token fashion. It uses the encoder’s context vectors, and internal hidden states to generate the next word in the sequence. To avoid information loss, especially when dealing with long input sequences, an \"attention mechanism\" is typically used that allows the decoder to pay attention to certain parts of the input sequence, rather than using the entire fixed context at every step. However, in this tutorial, we only consider the use of standard RNNs, which will limit the performance of our model."

    "\n",
    "create_history_pairs Function: This function creates training pairs that include the history of the conversation. For each exchange in the pairs, it appends a certain number of previous exchanges (up to MAX_HISTORY) separated by the <EOS> token. These pairs are then used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Preparation (batch_to_train_data): The function for preparing a batch of training data remains largely the same. The only difference is that it now handles input sequences that include conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Function (train):\n",
    "    The core training logic remains unchanged.\n",
    "    The function receives input sequences that now contain conversation history.\n",
    "    The forward pass through the encoder and the decoding steps are performed as usual, without any specific changes needed to accommodate the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation for Training:\n",
    "    The history_pairs are generated using the create_history_pairs function.\n",
    "    These pairs are then used throughout the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes for Evaluation with Conversation History\n",
    "\n",
    "evaluate Function:\n",
    "    The conversation history is now considered when evaluating a new input.\n",
    "    The history is concatenated with the current input sentence, separated by spaces.\n",
    "    The concatenated string is then processed and fed into the model for generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "evaluate_input Function:\n",
    "    Manages interactive evaluation with the user.\n",
    "    Maintains a conversation_history list, appending each user input and the model's response to it.\n",
    "    Passes the accumulated conversation history to the evaluate function for each new input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and Evaluation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained with input sequences that include conversation history, allowing it to learn the context of the conversation.\n",
    "During evaluation, the model uses the accumulated conversation history to generate more context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Model, optimizer, and training configurations are set according to your specifications.\n",
    "The training process (train_iters) follows the standard approach but uses the modified input pairs with conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of including conversation history in the model depends on the depth of context the model can understand and how well it can handle longer input sequences.\n",
    "Fine-tuning and experimenting with the MAX_HISTORY parameter and the MAX_LENGTH of sequences may be necessary to achieve optimal performance."
