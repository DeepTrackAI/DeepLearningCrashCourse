1. [Dense Neural Networks for Classification](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch01_DNN_classification)  
   Introduces single- and multi-layer perceptrons for classification tasks (e.g., MNIST digit recognition).

2. [Dense Neural Networks for Regression](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch02_DNN_regression)  
   Explores regression problems and digital twins, focusing on continuous-value prediction with multi-layer networks.

3. [Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Analysis](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch03_CNN)  
   Covers convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application to tasks such as image classification, localization, style transfer, and DeepDream.

4. [Encoders–Decoders for Latent Space Manipulation](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch04_AE)  
   Focuses on autoencoders, variational autoencoders, Wasserstein autoencoders, and anomaly detection, enabling data compression and generation.

5. [U-Nets for Image Transformation](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch05_UNet)  
   Discusses U-Net architectures for image segmentation, cell counting, and various biomedical imaging applications.

6. [Self-Supervised Learning to Exploit Symmetries](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch06_SelfSupervised)  
   Explains how to use unlabeled data and the symmetries symmetries of a problem for improved model performance with an application in particle localization.

7. [Recurrent Neural Networks for Timeseries Analysis](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch07_RNN)  
   Uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs), GRUs, and LSTMs to forecast time-dependent data and build a simple text translator.

8. [Attention and Transformers for Sequence Processing](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch08_Attention)  
   Introduces attention mechanisms, transformer models, and vision transformers (ViT) for natural language processing (NLP) including improved text translation and sentiment analysis, and image classification.

9. [Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch09_GAN)  
   Demonstrates generative adversarial networks (GAN) training for image generation, domain translation (CycleGAN), and virtual staining in microscopy.

10. [Diffusion Models for Data Representation and Exploration](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch10_Diffusion)  
    Presents denoising diffusion models for generating and enhancing images, including text-to-image synthesis and image super-resolution.

11. **Graph Neural Networks for Relational Data Analysis**  
    Shows how graph neural networks (GNNs) can model graph-structured data (molecules, cell trajectories, physics simulations) using message passing and graph convolutions.

>   - [**Code 11-1: Predicting Molecular Properties with Graph Neural Networks**]()  
>     Demonstrates how to implement graph convolutional and message-passing layers, apply them to the ZINC dataset, and predict molecular logP values. It highlights the stepwise approach of building GNN layers, normalizing adjacency matrices, handling node and edge embeddings, and combining them with readouts for regression on chemical compounds.
>
>   - [**Code 11-A: Simulating Complex Physical Phenomena with Graph Neural Networks**]()  
>     Implements a graph-based simulator for granular particle systems (SAND dataset). It shows how a GNN can learn to predict accelerations of interacting particles from observations and iteratively simulates the system dynamics faster than traditional force-field simulations.
>
>   - [**Code 11-B: Identifying Cell Trajectories with MAGIK**]()  
>     Constructs a directed graph to model cell movement across frames in biological imaging, then trains a simplified MAGIK network to classify edges as true connections. Post-processing recovers trajectories that approximate cells’ paths accurately, even through divisions or noisy segmentations.

12. [Active Learning for Continuous Learning](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch12_AL)  
    Describes techniques to iteratively select the most informative samples to label, improving model performance efficiently.

13. [Reinforcement Learning for Strategy Optimization](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch13_RL)  
    Explains Q-learning and Deep Q-learning by teaching an agent to master games such as Tetris.

14. [Reservoir Computing for Predicting Chaos](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepLearningCrashCourse/tree/main/Ch14_RC)  
    Covers reservoir computing methods for forecasting chaotic systems such as the Lorenz attractor.
