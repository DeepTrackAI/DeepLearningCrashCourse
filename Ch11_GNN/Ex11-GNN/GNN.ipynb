    "### Understanding Graph Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph convolutions are pivotal to graph neural networks (GNNs). To understand graph convolutions, it's helpful to first consider convolutions in the context of images. In image processing, convolution operations involve applying a filter or kernel to an image. This filter moves systematically over the image, performing element-wise multiplication with the part of the image it covers and adding up these products to create a new, transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs differ from images in that they do not have a regular, grid-like structure. Instead, they consist of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections or relationships), which are not arranged in any fixed, orderly pattern. This lack of structure presents a unique challenge for applying convolution operations, as there is no straightforward way to \"slide\" a kernel over the nodes of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph convolutions redefine the convolution operation to suit the unique structure of graphs. The idea is to aggregate information from nodes' neighborhood (i.e., the immediate connections of a node) by computing a weighted sum of the adjacent node features. The weights can be determined in various ways, often involving the properties of the edges or the nodes themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph connectivity defines how information flows during convolution. This connectivity is often represented by an adjacency matrix $A$, where each entry $A_{ij}$ is set to 1 if there is a link between nodes $i$ and $j$, and 0 otherwise. $A$ can represent both directed and undirected graphs. In a directed graph, an entry $A_{ij}​=1$ implies a directed edge from node $i$ to node $j$, indicating the direction of information flow. Conversely, in undirected graphs, $A_{ij} = A_{ji} = 1$ reflects bidirectional edges, allowing information to flow in both directions. This structure underpins the aggregation process in graph convolution, steering the feature integration from neighboring nodes to capture the graph's topology. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a simple cycle graph."

    "**Propagate** is responsible for the diffusion of information across the graph. During this phase, each node's transformed features are shared with its neighbors, allowing for information aggregation from node's local neighborhood. \n",

    "Before proceeding, it is essential to note that the `GCL` implementation is functional but not practical. This is because two major limitations hinder its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, our current implementation of `GraphConvolution` aggregates features from neighboring nodes, but it does not consider the attributes of the nodes themselves. The significance of this shortfall cannot be overstated, as in real-world scenarios, node's intrinsic attributes often play a pivotal role in the convolution operation, influencing the outcome and effectiveness of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major limitation revolves around the lack of normalization within $A$. Normalization is crucial in ensuring that the aggregation of features across nodes is balanced and meaningful. Without normalization, nodes with a higher degree (i.e., a greater number of neighbors) will naturally result in larger aggregated feature values than those with fewer neighbors. This discrepancy can lead to a pronounced variance in the aggregated features, potentially skewing the model's performance and its ability to generalize across the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve these issues, [Kipf and Welling (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) proposed a simple yet effective solution that addresses both limitations. Their approach introduces self-loops to the adjacency matrix and normalizes the aggregated features. This normalization is achieved by dividing the aggregated features by the square root of the product of the degree of the source and target nodes."
